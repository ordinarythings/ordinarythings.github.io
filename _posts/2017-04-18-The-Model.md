I stood amidst the chaos of the convention floor. People ran in every direction, immersed in the tingling anxiety of competition. The air smelled of metal and adrenaline.

She walked toward me. Her thin legs moving in confident strides that juxtaposed the sad expression on her face. She gave me a shy smile, the corners of her lip pointing up.

I put my things down on the floor, took two steps forward, and hugged her. Her arms wrapped around my back. My fingers dug in her long, blonde hair. Gentle.

We stood there, our quiet embrace in the hectic convention floor like an oasis, like touching ground after a long, uncomfortable flight.

"I needed that," she said. "You're a good hugger, did you know?"

That was the last time I saw her.
